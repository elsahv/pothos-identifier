    <h1>About Elsa and this blog</h1>
    <p>Since graduating with my Bachelor’s Degree in Nutrition and Food Science, my career and life goals have had a few wonderful (and not so wonderful!) plot twists…. </p>


    <p>It wasn't until graduation when I realized that I wanted to do something different with my life. I know... pretty cliche!!</p>
    <p>After some floundering and trying a few different jobs, I've realized how much I wanted to pursue a creative career in front-end development.</p><br>
    <p>One thing that remains unchanged however, is my interest in food chemistry and fitness. Some time has passed... to be honest, I had forgotten a lot of things learned from my classes. I still love nutrition, and have decided to use this blog to
      supplement my web developers portfolio, and to remember some of those forgotten facts.</p>
    <br>

      <h2>What this blog is not about</h2>
      <li>Small disclaimer: I’m not a dietitian, lifestyle coach, or fitness trainer, I’m not really an advocate of diets either.
      </li>
      <li> I’m an aspiring web developer who loves foods equally, whether its healthy/organic, or processed and fattening.</li>
      <li> My goal with this blog is to research and remember all the fun food facts I’ve learned in college, and to create and retain a healthier, more positive lifestyle.</li>
    </ul>
